## Product Requirements Document: "Animated Weather" (Working Title)

**1. Introduction**
This document outlines the product requirements for "Animated Weather," an iOS weather application designed for general users. The app will provide current weather conditions and a 7-day forecast for the user's current location, distinguished by its playful design and engaging animations.

**2. Goals**
*   To provide users with accurate and easy-to-understand weather information for their current location.
*   To create a delightful user experience through playful animations and a clean interface.
*   To develop a native iOS application using Swift and SwiftUI, leveraging Apple's WeatherKit for data.

**3. Target Audience**
*   General iOS users who need a quick and visually appealing way to check the weather.

**4. Product Features**

    **4.1. Core Functionality**
        *   **Current Weather Display:**
            *   Show current temperature.
            *   Display current weather conditions (e.g., Sunny, Cloudy, Rain, Snow) with corresponding animations.
            *   Show "Feels like" temperature.
            *   Display wind speed and direction.
            *   Show humidity levels.
            *   Display UV index.
            *   Show precipitation chance and amount.
        *   **7-Day Forecast:**
            *   Display a 7-day forecast, showing:
                *   Day of the week.
                *   High and low temperatures for each day.
                *   A representative icon/animation for the weather condition of each day (e.g., sun for sunny, cloud for cloudy).
        *   **Location Services:**
            *   Automatically detect and display weather for the user's current location.
            *   Request location permission gracefully.
            *   Provide a way for the user to refresh the weather data based on their current location.

    **4.2. User Interface & User Experience (UI/UX)**
        *   **Playful Design:**
            *   Utilize a bright, friendly color palette.
            *   Employ custom icons and illustrations that are playful and engaging.
        *   **Engaging Animations:**
            *   Weather conditions (current and forecast) will be represented by smooth and delightful animations (e.g., animated raindrops for rain, a shining sun for clear skies, gentle cloud movements).
            *   Transitions between different views or data points should be animated smoothly.
        *   **Simplicity and Clarity:**
            *   The app interface will be intuitive and easy to navigate.
            *   Weather information will be presented clearly and concisely.

    **4.3. Technical Requirements**
        *   **Platform:** iOS.
        *   **Programming Language & Framework:** Swift & SwiftUI.
        *   **Weather Data Source:** Apple WeatherKit.
            *   Requires appropriate Apple Developer Program membership and configuration for WeatherKit access.
        *   **Location:** Utilize iOS Core Location services.

**5. Design and UX Considerations**
*   **Animations:** The core differentiator. Animations should be:
    *   Performant and not drain battery excessively.
    *   Visually appealing and contextually relevant to the weather condition.
    *   Non-intrusive and enhance, not obstruct, information.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure the app is accessible, considering text size, contrast, and VoiceOver support.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Clearly communicate when location services are unavailable or denied.
    *   Handle API errors from WeatherKit gracefully (e.g., no network, data unavailable).

**6. Monetization**
*   Not applicable for the initial version.

**7. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for V1)**
*   Search for weather in other locations.
*   Hourly forecast.
*   Weather alerts/notifications.
*   Customizable units (Celsius/Fahrenheit).
*   Widgets.
*   Apple Watch app.

**8. Success Metrics**
*   User engagement (e.g., daily active users, session length).
*   App Store rating and reviews.
*   User feedback on the design and animations.
