   * [ ] Implement weather condition indicator with simplified animation
   * [ ] Display "Feels like" temperature in a secondary position
   * [ ] Create compact display for wind, humidity, and precipitation chance

5. **Watch-Optimized Animations:**
   * [ ] Create simplified versions of iOS weather animations
   * [ ] Implement battery-efficient animation system
   * [ ] Design animations that work well on the smaller watch display
   * [ ] Create a watch-optimized version of the starfield animation

6. **User Interaction:**
   * [ ] Implement pull-to-refresh gesture for manual data updates
   * [ ] Add haptic feedback for significant weather changes
   * [ ] Optimize UI for Digital Crown navigation

## Phase 3: UI Development - Forecast Views
7. **Today's Forecast:**
   * [ ] Create a view for today's high and low temperatures
   * [ ] Implement a simple visual indicator for today's weather progression

8. **Hourly Forecast:**
   * [ ] Design a compact hourly forecast view for the next 3-4 hours
   * [ ] Implement horizontal scrolling for additional hours
   * [ ] Create simplified hourly condition icons

9. **3-Day Forecast:**
   * [ ] Implement a 3-day forecast view accessible via Digital Crown
   * [ ] Create compact daily forecast rows with day, high/low temps, and condition icon
   * [ ] Optimize layout for the watch screen dimensions

## Phase 4: Complications Development
10. **Small Complication:**
    * [ ] Design and implement small complication showing temperature and tiny condition icon
    * [ ] Ensure readability at small sizes
    * [ ] Implement complication data refresh logic

11. **Medium Complication:**
    * [ ] Design and implement medium complication with temperature, condition icon, and high/low
    * [ ] Create layout that works across different watch faces

12. **Large Complication:**
    * [ ] Design and implement large complication with current temp, animated condition, and feels-like
    * [ ] Create efficient animations for the complication

13. **Corner Complications:**
    * [ ] Implement corner complications showing temperature only
    * [ ] Ensure high contrast for outdoor visibility

## Phase 5: Integration & Performance
14. **Handoff Support:**
    * [ ] Implement Handoff between watch app and iOS app
    * [ ] Test seamless transition between devices

15. **Standalone Mode:**
    * [ ] Implement basic functionality when iPhone is not in range
    * [ ] Test watch app behavior with and without phone connectivity

16. **Performance Optimization:**
    * [ ] Audit and optimize battery usage
    * [ ] Reduce unnecessary data transfers between devices
    * [ ] Optimize animation performance
    * [ ] Implement efficient background refresh strategy

## Phase 6: Testing & Refinement
17. **Watch-Specific Testing:**
    * [ ] Test on different watch sizes and models
    * [ ] Verify complication behavior on various watch faces
    * [ ] Test in different lighting conditions for readability
    * [ ] Measure and optimize battery impact

18. **Accessibility:**
    * [ ] Implement VoiceOver support for all watch app elements
    * [ ] Test with extra-large text sizes
    * [ ] Ensure sufficient contrast ratios for outdoor visibility

19. **Final Polish:**
    * [ ] Refine animations and transitions
    * [ ] Ensure consistent design language with iOS app
    * [ ] Optimize launch time and responsiveness
