# SimpleWeather Watch App Requirements

## Overview
The SimpleWeather Watch App will be a companion to the iOS SimpleWeather application, providing users with quick access to essential weather information directly on their Apple Watch. The app will maintain the same playful design philosophy and engaging animations while being optimized for the smaller watch interface.

## Core Features

### 1. Current Weather Display
- **Current Temperature**: Prominently displayed with large, readable text
- **Weather Condition**: Show current conditions (Sunny, Cloudy, Rain, Snow) with simplified animations
- **Feels Like Temperature**: Secondary display of perceived temperature
- **Quick Stats**: A compact view of key metrics:
  - Wind speed and direction
  - Humidity percentage
  - Precipitation chance

### 2. Simplified Forecast
- **Today's Forecast**: High and low temperatures for the current day
- **Next 12 Hours**: Simple hourly forecast with small icons for the next 3-4 hours visible at a glance
- **3-Day Outlook**: Accessible via Digital Crown scroll, showing simplified daily forecasts

### 3. Complications
- **Small Complication**: Current temperature and tiny weather condition icon
- **Medium Complication**: Temperature, condition icon, and high/low for the day
- **Large Complication**: Current temperature, condition with animation, and feels-like temperature
- **Corner Complications**: Temperature only

### 4. Animations & Design
- **Simplified Animations**: Optimized versions of the iOS app animations that maintain visual appeal while being performance-conscious
- **Watch-Optimized Starfield**: A simplified version of the starfield animation for the About screen
- **Dark Mode Focus**: Primarily dark backgrounds to conserve battery and improve readability outdoors
- **High Contrast**: Ensure all text and icons are highly readable in various lighting conditions

### 5. User Interaction
- **Refresh Gesture**: Pull down to refresh weather data
- **Location Sharing**: Utilize the same location data as the iOS app
- **Haptic Feedback**: Subtle haptics when weather conditions change significantly

### 6. Integration with iOS App
- **Shared Data Model**: Weather data synchronized between watch and phone
- **Standalone Capability**: Basic functionality when iPhone is not in range
- **Handoff Support**: Seamless transition between watch app and iOS app

## Technical Requirements

### Development Approach
- **SwiftUI**: Leverage SwiftUI for consistent UI development across platforms
- **watchOS Compatibility**: Support watchOS 9.0 and newer
- **WeatherKit Integration**: Use the same WeatherKit API as the iOS app
- **Battery Optimization**: Ensure animations and data fetching are optimized for watch battery life

### Data Management
- **Efficient Updates**: Minimize data transfer between phone and watch
- **Background Updates**: Periodic background refresh of weather data
- **Caching**: Store recent weather data for offline viewing

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Experience
- Basic watch app with current conditions and temperature
- Simple complications
- Shared data model with iOS app

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Add simplified animations
- Implement 3-day forecast view
- Develop all complication types

### Phase 3: Refinement
- Performance optimization
- Battery usage improvements
- Animation polish
- User testing and feedback implementation

## Success Metrics
- User engagement with watch app vs. opening the phone app
- Complication usage statistics
- Battery impact measurements
- User feedback on convenience and design
